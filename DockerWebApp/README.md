# DockerWebApp
ðŸš€ Dockerized Node.js Web App

DockerWebApp is a basic Node.js web application designed to demonstrate containerization using Docker and service orchestration with Docker Compose. The application runs an Express server that responds with a simple "Hello" message in the browser. It is configured to expose port 3000 inside the container and map it to a custom port on the host machine, making it accessible via the browser. This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to build, run, and manage a Node.js app using modern container tools.
